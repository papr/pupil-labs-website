We are happy to share the new [Picoflexx backend for Pupil Capture](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil-picoflexx) with you.
It adds support for [pmd's 3d time-of-flight camera](https://pmdtec.com/picofamily/).
For this plugin to work, you are required to [request a copy of pmd's proprietary software](https://pmdtec.com/picofamily/software/).
