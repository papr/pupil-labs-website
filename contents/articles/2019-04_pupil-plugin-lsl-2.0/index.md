We are excited to announce the all new 2.0 version of the [Pupil LSL Relay plugin](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-PupilLabs/releases/tag/v2.0) for Pupil Capture!

[Lab Streaming Layer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/) (LSL) is a system that provides unified collection of measurement time series between programs, computers, and devices over a network for distributed signal transport, time synchronization, and data collection. LSL has an extensive range of supported measurement modalities including eye tracking.

The new [Pupil LSL Relay plugin](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-PupilLabs/releases/tag/v2.0) features a unified data outlet that follows the official [`Gaze Meta Data`](https://github.com/sccn/xdf/wiki/Gaze-Meta-Data) format. Additionally, Pupil Capture uses the LSL's framework clock for simpler and more precise time synchronization.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-PupilLabs/releases/tag/v2.0) for more details.
